    <h2>A South American Treat</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>1 Kg Yellow Potatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>1/2 Red Onion</li>
        <li>2 Lemons</li>
        <li></li>180 g Tuna in Oil</li>
        <li>1 Tomato</li>
        <li>2 Avocados</li>
        <li>2 cups Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li> teaspoon Yellow Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>8 units Botija Olives</li>
        <li>2 Boiled Eggs</li>
        <li>Pepper strips</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        First, start by cooking the yellow potatoes. To do this, peel and wash all the potatoes, place them in a pot with water and boil them until they are soft enough to mash into a puree.

        Season the mashed yellow potatoes with salt, pepper, lemon, yellow pepper blend, and vegetable oil. At the same time, drain the tuna and mix it with the mayonnaise and finely chopped onion.
        The traditional presentation of the Causa Alimeña is layered, so to assemble the dish, you’ll need a cooking ring. Place it on the plate where you are going to serve the causa and make a first layer of mashed potatoes, then add a portion of tuna, and on top add finely chopped tomatos and avocado slices.
        Finally, place another layer of mashed potato and leave in the refrigerator until serving time.
        Serve it with strips of pepper, cooked egg, mayonnaise, and a touch of parsley to decorate the dish.

    <h2>A variation on a classic</h2>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 bag of frozen tater tots</li> 
        <li> 1 pound bacon- diced</li> 
        <li> 4 eggs</li> 
        <li> 1 tablespoon vinegar</li> 
<h4>Hollandaise: Sauce</h4>
        <li> 3 egg yolks</li> 
        <li> 1/8 teaspoon salt</li> 
        <li> 1-2 tablespoons lemon juice</li> 
         <li> 1/2 cup melted butter</li> 
        <li> hot sauce of your choice</li> 
    </ul>
   <h3>Instructions</h3> 
 <ol>
    Bake the tater tots on a baking sheet according to package directions.
    Fry the diced bacon until cooked, drain and set aside.
    Place the egg yolks and lemon juice in a small double boiler pot. If you prefer less lemony sauce, only use 1 tbsp.
    Whisk over the hot water until the egg yolks become glossy.
    
    Whisk in the butter slowly, a little bit at a time, until it's thoroughly incorporated. Keep whisking or the sauce will break.
    Once the butter is added, whisk in the hot sauce and cook a minute or two more, whisking the entire time.
    To poach your eggs, use a deep frying pan filled with water or a small pot. Add in the vinegar and bring to a boil.
    Add some water to your already hot pot to bring it up to about half full. Once the water boils, break the eggs into it.
    Cook for 2-3 minutes then remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and drain.
    Divide equal amounts of bacon and tater tots between four plates.
    Top with a poached egg and Hollandaise.
    
    Serve and enjoy!
